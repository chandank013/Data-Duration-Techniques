# 📊 Data Curation Techniques — Coding Practice

Welcome to the repository for my coding practice based on the **Data Curation Techniques** course at my college. This repository includes practical implementations of essential data preparation, cleaning, and preprocessing techniques frequently used in data science and analytics workflows.

## 📌 Topics Covered

This repository demonstrates the following techniques:

- 📄 **Static Web Scraping**  
  Extracting structured data from static HTML pages using libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.

- 🌐 **Dynamic Web Scraping**  
  Handling websites that load data dynamically using JavaScript, implemented via tools like `Selenium`.

- 🧹 **Handling Missing Values**  
  Techniques such as deletion, mean/median/mode imputation, forward/backward fill, and interpolation.

- 🗑️ **Handling Duplicates**  
  Detecting and removing duplicate records in datasets using Pandas.

- 📈 **Handling Noise in Data**  
  Techniques like binning, smoothing, and outlier detection to clean inconsistent or extreme data.

- 📊 **Data Normalization**  
  Scaling numerical data using Min-Max Scaling, Z-Score normalization, and Decimal Scaling.

- 🔍 **Sampling Methods**  
  Implementing Random Sampling, Stratified Sampling, and Systematic Sampling to select representative subsets of data.

- 🧭 **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
  Dimensionality reduction technique to transform high-dimensional data into fewer dimensions while preserving variance.

- 📝 **Data Encoding**  
  Converting categorical data into numerical format using Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, and Ordinal Encoding.

- 📊 **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**  
  Measuring the linear relationship between pairs of continuous variables.

- 📊 **Chi-Square Test**  
  Assessing the independence between two categorical variables using the chi-squared statistical test.
